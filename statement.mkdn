Purpose: to investigate the applicability of affine linear functions as basis for flat
index computation in multidimensional arrays. Might have novel applications in array slicing,
but may have performance penalties. Also, possible theoretical digression into correspondence between
operations on one-dimensional integer 'shape' arrays, and multidimensional array operations.
